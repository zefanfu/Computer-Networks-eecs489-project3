# Computer-Networks-eecs489-project3

This is the project 3 of Computer Networks course.

In this project, I build a simple reliable transport protocol, WTP, on top of UDP. My WTP implementation provides in­order, reliable delivery of UDP datagrams in the presence of events like packet loss, delay, corruption, duplication, and re­ordering.
